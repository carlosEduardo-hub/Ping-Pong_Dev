# Ping-Pong_Dev

Welcome to the Ping-Pong Game! This is a project implementing a classic ping-pong game using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game has been built with the help of the canvas and frame animation APIs to create an interactive and enjoyable experience.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a compatible web browser.
2. Use the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard to control the paddle and bounce the ball.
3. Try to keep the ball within the screen by rebounding it with the paddle.
4. Each time the ball passes the opponent's paddle, you earn a point.
5. Keep playing to see how high you can score!

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Basic page structure.
- CSS: Styling for the game's appearance and layout.
- JavaScript: Game logic and interactivity.
- Canvas API: Used for drawing graphics and animations on the screen.
- Frame Animation API: Employed for creating smooth and responsive animations.

## Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to play the game. No additional installations are required.

## Credits

This game was developed by Carlos Eduardo Mendes de Oliveira.
